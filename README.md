# Predicting Grades

This is a simple project, inspired by [IBM Machine Learning with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/home/info) course. Aim of the project was to predict student grades at my faculty, Electrical Engineering in Belgrade, based on their index and grades on previous exams. 
Project is based on multiple linear regression, implemented with sklearn library in Python.
